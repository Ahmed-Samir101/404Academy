                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Audrey (Chinese name: 魏晓彤). I’m a computer science major from Indonesia. I’m the CIO and writer of the group Three Amigos. I was responsible for writing the text content of our website as well as submitting the project. Aside from programming and studies, I like to crochet and knit.

                    <h2>My Career</h2>
                    <p>
                        I’ve always been interested in computers since I was little. My first laptop was an Elevo R10 that was a few years older than I was at the time. It was an old slow thing that I somehow managed to work on until highschool. It is still alive and running Linux at the time of writing this, it will outlive any of my future computers at this rate and I won’t have it any other way.

                    <h2>What I Love</h2>
                    <p>I find the activity to be incredibly relaxing and helps flex some of my creative muscles. The plush dolls make an especially good gift for others too. I also like cute things and this hobby just gives me the power to feed my own addiction. At the time of writing this, I’m working on a raccoon plush and a blanket.                        </p>
